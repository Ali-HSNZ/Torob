Styles
    Base
        base program styles

    Components
        styles that are related to specific components in the project
        are placed in the components directory.

        For example,
        if you are creating a table style,
        you place this style file in /vendors/mantine because the table style
        related to the table *style in the Mantine library*.

    Vendors
        in this directory
        you keep styles that *reference external libraries* or special project component.
